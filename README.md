## Local Weather App.

Application that allows users to fetch local weather data from anywhere in the world using openweather.org (sp?) api.

MVP: as of 1/8/19
1. User can enter a city and get up to date weather info.
    Including:
    a. temp
    b. daily low
    c. daily high
    d. wind strength
    e. sky condition (clear, cloudy, rainy, etc.)
2. Temperatures only display in fahrenheit and there is no button to change
3. There are no graphics.
4. User has to click update to update, hitting enter does nothing.


To Do:
add custom search bar.
    - figure out how to get city IDs ?
    - add rendering of name of location weather is being displayed for.
    - add location service ? 
stylize and walk.

concerns:
FIXED: check into why state seems to be taking two clicks to update ??
NEW: add loading icon while waiting
     add degree symbols
     add degree switching.

...
set in heroku.... or git pages.
